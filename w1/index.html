    <p>
      My name is Jeremy Ortega, but I go by JJ pretty much everywhere. I came to NEIT because I felt like it offered what I was looking for in a college, and when I came to open house it just felt like the right college for me. I was born in Providence, Rhode Island, to a father from Guatemala & a mother from Colombia. I've always loved technology so I felt like picking cybersecurity was the best course for me to participate in. Also, here are some cool things you can do in HTML! Here's a <b>bolded word</b>, <i>italized word</i>, and <u>underlined word</u>. Pretty cool if you ask me.
