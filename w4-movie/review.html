            <h2>REVIEW</h2>

            <p class="review1"><em>Scarface</em> is recognized as one of the most iconic crime dramas & mob movies of all time. The movie, focusing on the theme of the American Dream, and the lengths people are willing to go through for it. I really like how screenplay writer <i>Oliver Stone</i> & director <i>Brian De Palma</i> took this theme and put their own spin on it, instead highlighting how this ambitious pursuit of power actually lead to a man's downfall, highlighting that ambition may prove to be a dangerous tool if it falls into the wrong hands.</p>
            <p class="review2">Because of this, the character of Tony Montana, portrayed by <i>Al Pacino</i>, has become one of my most favorite characters in fiction ever. While I cannot claim that I will ever have the desire to becoming a druglord like he does, I can atleast somewhat resonate with his desire for wanting to achieve the American Dream, as I had immigrant parents come to America for that very reason. Unlike Tony, though, they are hard-working people with honest jobs. Complex characters, such as Tony, always appeal to me because they make me much more invested in the story and how they develop through the course of it. At the beginning, you wanted to root for Tony, he was a poor Cuban immigrant who was making money, but as the story progresses, you watch as he slowly hurts the people closest to him, and ends up being the orchestrator of his own downfall when he goes on a coke-induced rampage against all the enemies he's made due to the consequences of his own actions.</p>
