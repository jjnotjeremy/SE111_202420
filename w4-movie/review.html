                <ul>
                    <li id="trivia-list">After having his movie rated "X" three times before finally getting it approved as "R", director Brian De Palma released the original cut of the film to cinemas because he felt like the studio executives couldn't tell the difference.</li>
                    <li id="trivia-list">Steven Bauer did not audition for his role as Manny, instead his appearance was judged by casting director Alixe Gordin as perfect for the role.</li>
                    <li id="trivia-list">Michelle Pfeiffer's amusement in the scene where Tony puts on her hat that she had slipped on was genuine, as Pacino's actions were not in the script.</li>
